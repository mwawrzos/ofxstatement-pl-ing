# ING Belgium plugin for ofxstatement 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project provides a custom plugin for [ofxstatement](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement) for ING (PL). It is based
on the work done by Bernardo Bandos (https://github.com/TheoMarescaux/ofxstatement-be-ing) and Fabian H. (https://github.com/fabolhak/ofxstatement-de-ing)
and corrected for the csv files generated by the Polish ING banking.

`ofxstatement`_ is a tool to convert proprietary bank statement to OFX format,
suitable for importing to GnuCash. Plugin for ofxstatement parses a
particular proprietary bank statement format and produces common data
structure, that is then formatted into an OFX file.

Users of ofxstatement have developed several plugins for their banks. They are
listed on main [`ofxstatement`](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement) site. If your bank is missing, you can develop
your own plugin.
